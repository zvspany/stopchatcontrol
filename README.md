## 🌐 Overview
**#StopChatControl** warns about the EU's controversial "Chat Control" proposal.  
It threatens the **privacy** and **freedom of speech** of all EU citizens by proposing mandatory scanning of all messages and images, including encrypted communication.

We aim to **inform**, **educate**, and **mobilize action** to protect digital rights.
